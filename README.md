# all-the-colours
<ul>
<li> An html file containing all the named colours I could find. A total of 2653 named colours are present, sorted alphabetically. The corresponding python code just generates the divs and css needed for the file.</li>
<li> The two additional files wiki_colours.txt and colours.json are the inputs to the python file, they contain the colour names I have scraped from wikipedia and some other website which was offering a whole bunch of colour names.</li> 
<li>Just download and run the html file on any browser to see the following output.</li>
</ul>
